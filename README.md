For now:




General, architectural approach to modern applications:

Reactive Programming:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming
FRP (also mentioned in the frameworks video below):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming
there are many better links: …

Example using Akka/Scala:

Streaming frameworks:

Various architectures for dealing with concurrency (great description of tradeoffs):
(it’s based on Scala, but you don’t need to know it to watch the video)

Message delivery guarantees (do you need reliable messaging, what’s the cost?):
